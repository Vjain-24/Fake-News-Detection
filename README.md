# Fake-News-Detection

In this project, we have used various natural language processing(NLP) techniques and LSTM-Recurrent Neural Network.
Deep learning models are widely used for linguistic modeling. Typical deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) can detect complex patterns in textual data. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a tree-structured recurrent neural network used to analyze variable-length sequential data.
